          Eden was born out of the <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>frustration</span> that is <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>Canadian real estate</span>. Like many average Canadians, Eden's founders, Milad and Ben, are systematically <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>shut out</span> of the market while <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>prices continue to rise</span>, and <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>policy after policy fails</span> to remedy the situation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className='p-text'>
          In late 2021, inspired by John F. Kennedy's famous line, Ben had a question. <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country</span>. How do we, as average Canadians, <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>take back control</span> of our real estate market?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className='p-text'>
          A few weeks later, <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>Canadaâ€™s first crowdfunding platform for ethical real estate investments</span> was launched. Our mission is to harness the power of communal investing to address Canada's housing woes faster than any government or wealthy developer can. Together, we can <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>provide more ethical long-term rentals</span>, <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>extend the useful life of aging buildings</span>, and <span className='app__bluetext bold-text'>build new housing options</span>.
